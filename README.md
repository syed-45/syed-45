<!-- ### Hi there 👋 -->

# Hello, I'm Syed! 👋

I graduated with a BSc in Mathematics and Statistics. Within my degee course, I completed several coding modules of which I really enjoyed and did well in. I also took the initiative whilst still at university to work on a coding project for my local community involving building a prayer times widget of which I recieved positive feedback. This lead me to complete the technology leadership program at [Academy](https://academy.tech), where I trained in full-stack development and leadership. I successfully built a number of full-stack applications in teams using technologies including React.js, Node.js, Express.js and PostgreSQL. I also incorporated agile methodologies within these projects such as participating in retrospectives and implementing CI/CD with git and GitHub. After Academy, I am looking for full-time roles within tech to contribute my skills and experience and develop myself further.

## 🌱 Looking to Learn

I believe in continuous learning and improvement. Currently, I am looking forward to learning:

- Deepening my knowledge of data structures and algorithms through completing the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass By Colt Steele on Udemy.
- Mobile app development with React Native.

## 🚀 Future Project

- I'm excited about my upcoming project to create an Arabic quiz app using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js with Express, and PostgreSQL. This app will offer users the opportunity to test their knowledge of Arabic vocabulary.
